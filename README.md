SOCK ME!
=========
Sample TCP Socket Client and Server. Both a client and server are available in C# .NET and Perl. This is just a demo to compare how the two langauages talk at the loweset level. The Perl client can talk to the C# server, and vice-versa.

The clients just send plain text to the server, which listens and prints everything it receives.

A future idea is to use protobuf to package objects and send them between language barriers.
